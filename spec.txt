Formula:
(p - 1) / (t + 2)^1.5

Description:
Votes divided by age factor

p = votes (points) from users.
t = time since submission in hours.

p is subtracted by 1 to negate submitters vote.
age factor is (time since submission in hours plus two) to the power of 1.5.

To compute number of seconds since a particular time:

SELECT (strftime('%s', 'now') - strftime('%s', createdt)) / 60 FROM entry;

sql with random votes:
SELECT (ABS(RANDOM()) % 100) / ((STRFTIME('%s','now')-STRFTIME('%s',e.createdt))/60/60 + 2) * ((STRFTIME('%s','now')-STRFTIME('%s',e.createdt))/60/60 + 2) FROM entry e;
