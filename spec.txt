Hackernews points formula
-------------------------
(p - 1) / (t + 2)^1.5

Votes divided by age (gravity) factor
p = votes (points) from users.
t = time since submission in hours.

p is subtracted by 1 to negate submitters vote.
age factor is (time since submission in hours plus two) to the power of 1.5.

To compute number of seconds since a particular time:
SELECT (strftime('%s', 'now') - strftime('%s', createdt)) / 60 FROM entry;
